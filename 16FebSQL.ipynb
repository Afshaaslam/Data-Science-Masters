    "Ans.A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. \n",
    "A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS)\n",
    "SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options availabl\n",
    "It requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure. \n",
    "vertically scalable dbs\n",
    "Good support available from vendors\n",
    "SQL is a good choice when working with related data as info is provided in real time\n",
    "\n",
    "EG: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases. \n",
    "It has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store. \n",
    "This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first as each document has its own unique structure.\n",
    "Horizontally scalable\n",
    "Rely on community for support\n",
    "NoSQL is good when the availability of big data is more crucial and data sets are large and constantly changing\n",
