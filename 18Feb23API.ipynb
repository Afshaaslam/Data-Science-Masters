    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "Ans. API stands for 'Application Programming Interface',which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.\n",
    "This application software is used as a web application to connect user front end(client) and complex backend functionality (server).APIs ensure that distinct software work in unison.\n",
    "Hence, APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Data sync in our phone devices, ChatBots, Google Maps, E-Commerce, Payment gateways etc\n",
    "are few of the real examples where APIs are used in our daily life"

    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "Ans.Advantages:\n",
    "1 It decouples the front end and back end by communicating through API rather then directly.SP they are completely independent.\n",
    "2 Improved compatibility and accessibility as we only need to understand the API protocols.\n",
    "3 Faster and agile development, as the front and Back ends can work in parallel.\n",
    "4 Simpler to test and maintain as each component connects to API and communicates on its own so the modular approach makes it easier to test and maintain.\n",
    "5 Easier scalability as API architechture provides plug in services when required and remove when not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1 Adds to management burden if not automated, as the number increases and need to be monitored which means more infrastructure needed.\n",
    "2 unsecured APIs comes easily to attention of hackers so security could eb a concern\n",
    "3 Everyone from developer to tester need to be familier with how API works, it my require more trainign and upskilling the team\n"

    "Ans.\n",

    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP\n",
    "1 API Calls are not Cached. \n",

    "3 SOAP is slower than REST and consumes more bandwidth due to its complexity\n",
    "4 REST is more flexible and scalable.\n",
    "5 REST accesses data, whereas SOAP executes activities using a more standardized set of communications standards.\n",
