    "A1. Multithreading is the ability of a program to enable more than one user at a time without a need to have  multiple programs running at a time. It can handle multiple requests from the same user.\n",
    "It allows concurrent and parallel execution of various tasks.\n",
    "It is used to  efficiently utilise the resources as threads share same memory and data space.It reduces response time and increases performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python standard library provides 'Threading', which contains most of the primitives. Thread, in this module, nicely encapsulates threads, providing a clean interface to work with them."
